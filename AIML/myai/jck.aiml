        <pattern>WEIGHT FOUR TWO</pattern>

            <think>
                <set name="four">
                    <srai>多大了</srai>
                </set>
                <set name="two">
                    <srai>多大了</srai>
                </set>
            </think>
            <get name="four"/>
            is married to<get name="two"/>. At a conscious level,
            <get name="four"/>
            felt that he was a bit overweight and thoght he should lose some pounds. But part of him felt that he was
            going to attract too much attention to himself if he became slim again, and irrationally, that he might
            undermine his relationship with<get name="two"/>. In fact, once before when he was trimmer, he did have an
            affair and it almost ended his relationship with<get name="two"/>. Because they have a child together,
            <get name="four"/>
            is very worried about divorce, custody rights and the effect of their separation on the child and himself.
            So part of him thinks that keeping the pounds on will help him hang on to the stability of his relationship
            with<get name="two"/>.
